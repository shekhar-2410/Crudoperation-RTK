# Redux Toolkit CRUD Operations with React

This project is a simple web application built using React.js and Redux Toolkit (RTK) to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It incorporates Bootstrap for user-friendly styling and interaction within a table. 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), making it easy to start developing and testing the application locally. Below are some available scripts:

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode and opens it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. The app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code. If there are any linting errors, they will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Use this command to run the test runner in interactive watch mode. Check the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section in the Create React App documentation for more information on testing.

### `npm run build`

Running this command builds the app for production in the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for performance, including minifying the code and generating hashed filenames. The resulting app is ready for deployment.

For more information on deploying your React app, refer to the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section in the Create React App documentation.
